# Video-Surveillance-system
* A system to automate the task of analyzing video surveillance 
* Analyze the video feed in real-time and identify abnormal activity. 
### Introduction:
•	Events that are of interest in long video sequences, such as surveillance footage, often have an extremely low probability of occurring. As such, 
  manually detecting such events, or anomalies, is a very fussy job that often requires more manpower than is generally available.
•	There is an increasing need not only for recognition of objects and their behavior, but for detecting the rare, interesting occurrences of unusual 
  objects or suspicious behavior in the large body of ordinary data.
•	This has prompted the need for automated detection and segmentation of sequences of interest.
•	Video data is challenging to represent and model due to its high dimension- ality, noise, and a huge variety of events and interactions.
•	Early events are based on some predefined heuristics, which makes the detection model difficult to generalize to different surveillance scenes.
•	Our proposed method is domain free (i.e., not related to any specific task, no domain expert required), does not require any additional human effort, 
  and can be easily applied to different scenes.
•	To prove the effectiveness of the proposed method we apply the method to real-world datasets and show that our method consistently outperforms similar 
  methods while maintaining a short running time.
•	By incorporating convolutional feature extractor in both spatial and temporal space into the encoding-decoding structure, we build an end-to-end 
  trainable model for video anomaly detection. The advantage of our model is that it is semi-supervised – the only ingredient required is a long video 
  segment containing only normal events in a fixed view. Despite the model’s ability to detect abnormal events and its robustness to noise, depending on 
  the activity complexity in the scene, it may produce more false alarms compared to other methods.
